"make all"
to make all the necessary files for this project
files made is monitor.c, master.c, and slave.c
monitor.c is implemented as a library function call
monitor.h contains the structure for the monitor which are the
condition variables, condition sems, and condition functions

"./master"
will start the program
master.c forks slaves and execute them by execl "./slave"
master.c keeps a timer of the master process set to 300secs or 5 minutes
sets up and initialize mutex and next semaphore
has a signal for SIGALRM and SIGINT if ^c interupts process
after all slaves processes are done clean up sems and shared mem
after SIGALRM and SIGINT signals clean up sems and shared mem

"./slave"
will execute the code to enter the critical section and write
to the file "cstest"
will write to "cstest" a total of 3 times after which the 
slave process ends itself and exit

"make clean"
will clean up all executable files, object files, and the cstest file
