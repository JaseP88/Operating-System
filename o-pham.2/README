Operating System HW 2

There is two executables
master and slave

type: make all
	to make the 2 executables

type: make clean
	to clean up the executable and object files

After getting the 2 executable master and slave 
type: ./master
	to run both


the master program creates a fan of 19 child processes with fork
using exec, child processes enters race condition to write into a file called cstest

master cleans up any shared memory after termination from max writes, interrupts
or timer

master also handles termination of child processes by waiting on them
